    "# Uninformed Search\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the most basic form of seach.It implies trying to reach a goal state with no knowledge of where such goal state is.\n",
    "\n",
    "Threfore, every possible strategy will just move from one node to another and check whether we reached the goal state or not. It will keep expanding until we reach the goal state.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have an intrinsic measure of distance (or better, a *cost*) within a graph of nodes and paths, even if the absence of knowledge regarding the gold state: the number of steps associated to a given path. We can also consider adding other measure of distance given for example by the number of kilometers between the start state and our current state.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a graph with a cost defined for the paths, we can imagine 3 ways of searching.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: We start out with the root node and then expand the so-called frotier of examined nodes by considering other nodes that have the same *depth*. Here, the same depth means that the distance between the root node and each of the next-to-consider nodes is the same. In terms of the picture of a tree, this implies considering first expansions of the same depth. When there are ties (i.e. two nodes are one step away from current node) we can just pick one at random or use some rule of thumb.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: We expand the *deepest* node in the current frontier of the tree. This means that the search proceeds to the deepest level of the current node, up to the point where nodes have no successors. As those nodes are exanded, they are removed from the frontier, so then the algorithm backs up to the next deepest node. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Uniform Cost Seach**: Here the edges have a custom-defined cost and the expansion takes this into account, by expanding first the paths with the lowest cost $g(n)$. In fact, BFS can be considered as an optimal uniform cost search algorithm when all the costs are equal (the cost of a path is then directly proportional to the number of steps in the path).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "![BFSvsDFS](./DFSBFS.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The implementation of Uninformed Search in pseudocode is a follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```function Graph.Search(problem):\n",
    "  frontier = {[initial]}; explored={}\n",
    "  loop:\n",
    "    if frontier is empty: return FAIL\n",
    "    path = remove.choice(frontier)\n",
    "    s = path.end; add s to explored\n",
    "    if s is a goal: return path\n",
    "    for a in actions:\n",
    "        add[path + a -> Result(s,a)]\n",
    "        to frontier\n",
    "        unless Result(s,a) in frontier or explored\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "So we first have a frontier initialized with with the root node as the only node. Then, we remove a path from the frontier and consider the state `s` that the removed path leads to. Then we add `s` to the explored list. If `s` is the goal state, we return the path. If not, we add to the frontier all the paths that can be constructed starting from `s` and adding each and all of the possible actions `a` (we do this unless `s+a` is in the explored list or is already in the frontier).\n",
    "\n",
    "The difference between BFS and DFS is simply the path that is removed from the frontier at each iteration, i.e. the particular function or routine that we apply the line `path = remove.choice(frontier)` above. \n"

    "#### The Algorithm\n",
    "1. Create a `result` dictionary. At the end of the program, `result` will have the shortest distance (value) for all nodes (key) in the graph. For our example, it will become as `{'A': 0, 'B': 5, 'C': 3, 'D': 2, 'F': 6, 'E': 4}`<br><br>\n",
    "1. Start with the source node. Distance from source to source itself is 0.  <br><br>\n",
    "1. The distance to all other nodes from the source is unknown initially, therefore set the initial distance to infinity.  <br><br>\n",
    "1. Create a set `unvisited` containing nodes that have not been visited. Initially, it will have all nodes of the graph.<br><br>\n",
    "1. Create a `path` dictionary that keeps track of the previous node (value) that can lead to the current node (key) in an optimal way. At the end of the program, for our example, it will become as `{'B': 'A', 'C': 'D', 'D': 'A', 'F': 'C', 'E': 'C'}`. Values represent the **Previous Optimal Node**. Here, the Previous Optimal Node is the \"best\" node which could lead us to the current node (key). For instance, the previous optimal node of `'C'` is `'D'` because the optimal path (in term of distance) that starts at `'A'` and finishes at `'C'` passes through `'D'` before reaching `'C'`. In this sense, the optimal path between the source node (`'A'` in this case) and any of the other nodes can be found using `path`: start at the key given by the goal node and move backwards according to dictionary `path`. For example, If we want to know the optimal path from `'A'` to `'E'`, we note that `path['E']='C'`, then `path['C']='D'` and finally `path['D']='A'`, so the optimal path from `'A'` to `'E'` would be `'A' -> 'D' -> 'C' -> 'E' `. This dictionary `path` can be initialized as an empty one. <br><br>\n",
    "1. As long as `unvisited` is non-empty, repeat the following:\n",
    " - Find the unvisited node having smallest known distance from the *source node*. This defines the *current node* <br><br>\n",
    " - For the *current node*, find all the **unvisited neighbours** of it. Then calculate the distance of each unvisited neighbour to the *source node*.  <br><br>\n",
    " - If the calculated distance of the **unvisited neighbour** is less than the already known distance in `result` dictionary, update the shortest distance in the `result` dictionary. <br><br>\n",
    " - If there is an update in the `result` dictionary, you need to update the `path` dictionary as well for the same key. The update entails placing value = *current node*, being the key the neighbour of *current node* for which the distance in `result` has been updated. Basically, we are placing the new previous optimal node. <br><br>\n",
    " - Remove the current node from the `unvisited` set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that this (greedy) algorithm ensures finding an optimal solution for any given starting or *source node* because it looks for the minimum distance expanding from nodes that are the closest to the source at each time. The fact that the expansion is done according to distance (hence in an ordered way) allows the algorithm to be only $\\mathcal{O}(n^2)$: for each of the closest nodes to the source ($\\mathcal{O}(n)$) we search through all its neighbours ($\\mathcal{O}(n)$). So the search is actually done in triplets:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\text{source node} \\rightarrow \\text{current node} \\rightarrow \\text{current-node's neighbour} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "but this is OK because, as we expand in an ordered way, no matter how far a node is from the source, *current node* will always be closer to *source node* than its (unvisited) neighbours. For instance, imagine that there are two possible paths to reach node `'E'` from the source node `'A'`:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ A \\rightarrow F \\rightarrow D \\rightarrow E  $$\n",
    "$$ A \\rightarrow B \\rightarrow C \\rightarrow E  $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Both `'C'` and `'D'` are closer to `'A'` than `'E'` and this is crucial because this means that the algorithm will process them before processing `'E'`. Imagine that the optimal path from `'A'` to `'E'` passes through `'D'` but `'C'` is closer to `'A'` than `'D'`. Then, we will first process the triplet \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\text{source node} (A) \\rightarrow \\text{current node} (C) \\rightarrow \\text{current-node's neighbour} (E) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "and note that we can skip $B$ because it is not necessary, as we already know that the optimal path to $C$ passes through $B$. That is why we can express everything in terms of triplets only. This will give a value to `result` and `path`. But then, we will process \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\text{source node} (A) \\rightarrow \\text{current node} (D) \\rightarrow \\text{current-node's neighbour} (E) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "(again, `'F'` can be safely skipped as optimal path to `'D'` passes through `'F'` but this is not important). Si we have assumed that this path is optimal, values of `result` and `path` will be updated accordingly, reflecting this.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, crucially, optimal paths to a given node $N$ can be found in a Markovian way if we start from all the optimal paths to previous nodes whose neighbour is $N$ and search for the optimal 'step ahead'.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note** - This implementation of the Dijkstra's algorithm is not very efficient. Currently it has a $\\mathcal{O}(n^2)$  time complexity. We will see a better version in the next lesson - \"Graph Algorithms\" with $\\mathcal{O}(n\\log(n))$  time complexity."
